## TODO

- Redefine
- (optional) let the save button disabled if nothing input in create event page.

- [ ] A modal view: [creating an item](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/ImplementNavigation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH16-SW1)
  - Including save, cancel segue, and more!
- [x] How to collection: [testing collectionview from a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8_UsVoSfZE)
  - Also how to set round border, margin, see the video for detail

- [x] Concerns: how to deal with multiple teammembers [editing the same storyboard](https://www.marinosoftware.com/insights/storyboards-multiple-developers-and-git).
  - --> unless you're working on the **same view controller & more than one change**, otherwise it can auto merge most of the time
  - Important: dev should take ownership of his/her code & the one who modify it if a change is needed.
  - Important: work on different stuff. Don't work on the same feature, same view controller at the same time.
- ~~Create a clickable item in create account page nav, in order to `next` to next onboarding step.~~
- ~~Fix tab views title disappeared because there's a nav view at login/welcome overlaying.~~

## Collaboration Protocol

- If you add/remove file in Xcode, create pull request or let your team mate get updated by `git pull` **right away**; the `.pbxproj` merge conflict is not fun at all.
