## TODO

- [x] Concerns: how to deal with multiple teammembers [editing the same storyboard](https://www.marinosoftware.com/insights/storyboards-multiple-developers-and-git).
  - --> unless you're working on the **same view controller & more than one change**, otherwise it can auto merge most of the time
  - Important: dev should take ownership of his/her code & the one who modify it if a change is needed.
  - Important: work on different stuff. Don't work on the same feature, same view controller at the same time.
- ~~Create a clickable item in create account page nav, in order to `next` to next onboarding step.~~
- ~~Fix tab views title disappeared because there's a nav view at login/welcome overlaying.~~
